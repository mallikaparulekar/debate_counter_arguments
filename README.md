# debate_counter_arguments
When evidence is given by a team in the context of a larger piece of text, this code automatically scans it and tries to find counter arguments to the evidence in the same piece of text.

Uses a wit.ai nlp model built and trained online as a more scalable way to find the counter argument keywords, and can be extended to more complex cases in the future.
